<h1>Rails</h1>
<p>A wise man once said of Las Vegas:
<blockquote>"It is glorious that we can create something like this. It is shameful that we <em>did</em>."</blockquote> This is approximately how I feel about Rails.</p>

<h1>Dynamic Programming</h1>
<p>I am convinced that dynamic programming is a fad that has stuck around for no real reason. If you're writing an algorithm that has repeated subproblems, you can straightforwardly
  write a recursive algorithm that works intuitively. You can then add memoization, which in the right circumstances gives substantial benefits to speed at the cost of space.
  Or, you can rewrite the entire algorithm to optimize the subproblem records, i.e. dynamic programming, at the cost of comprehensibility for readers and considerable time and
  effort for the author. Choosing DP is almost always a mistake.</p>
